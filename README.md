This repository contains IoT practical experiments implemented on Arduino Uno using Tinkercad.
Each practical demonstrates different IoT concepts, sensors, and actuators.

1. LED Blinking :

Objective: To create a basic program that turns an LED on and off at regular intervals.

Components: Arduino Uno, LED, Resistor, Breadboard, Jumper Wires.

Description:
The LED is connected to a digital pin of Arduino. Using the digitalWrite() function with a delay, the LED blinks continuously.

Outcome: Introduction to digital output in IoT systems.

2. Traffic Light System :

Objective: To simulate a traffic light controller using multiple LEDs.

Components: Arduino Uno, 3 LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green), Resistors, Breadboard.

Description:
The Arduino controls the sequence of Red, Yellow, and Green LEDs with specific timing delays to mimic real-world traffic lights.

Outcome: Understanding control of multiple outputs with Arduino.

3. Temperature & Humidity Monitoring (DHT11 Sensor)

Objective: To measure and display real-time temperature and humidity data.

Components: Arduino Uno, DHT11 Sensor, LCD Display / Serial Monitor.

Description:
The DHT11 sensor captures temperature and humidity values. The Arduino reads the sensor data and displays it on the LCD or Serial Monitor.

Outcome: Learning sensor integration in IoT projects.

4. Smart Street Light (LDR + LED)

Objective: To automatically control street lights using an LDR sensor.

Components: Arduino Uno, LDR Sensor, LED, Resistor, Breadboard.

Description:
The LDR detects light intensity. When ambient light is low, the Arduino switches ON the LED (street light); when light is high, it switches OFF.

Outcome: Implementation of automation using sensors.

5. Motion Detection (PIR Sensor + Buzzer/LED)

Objective: To detect motion and trigger an alert system.

Components: Arduino Uno, PIR Sensor, Buzzer/LED.

Description:
The PIR sensor senses human movement. Upon detection, Arduino activates a buzzer or LED as an alert.

Outcome: Understanding real-world applications in security systems.

6. Gas Detection System (MQ2 Sensor)

Objective: To detect harmful gases in the environment.

Components: Arduino Uno, MQ2 Gas Sensor, Buzzer/LED.

Description:
The MQ2 sensor measures gas concentration. If gas level exceeds the threshold, Arduino triggers a buzzer/LED for alert.

Outcome: Learning environmental monitoring applications.

7. Ultrasonic Distance Measurement

Objective: To measure distance using an ultrasonic sensor.

Components: Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04), Buzzer/LED.

Description:
The ultrasonic sensor calculates distance by sending and receiving sound waves. Arduino processes the data and triggers output if distance is less than a limit.

Outcome: Understanding distance sensing and obstacle detection.

8. IoT-Based Home Automation (Switch Control)

Objective: To simulate a smart home lighting system.

Components: Arduino Uno, LEDs, Push Button / Virtual Switches.

Description:
Arduino is programmed to turn ON/OFF LEDs (appliances) using buttons or programmed conditions.

Outcome: Basics of home automation and IoT control.

9. Servo Motor Control (Door Lock System)

Objective: To control a servo motor for smart lock simulation.

Components: Arduino Uno, Servo Motor, Push Button.

Description:
The servo motor rotates to a specific angle when a button is pressed, simulating an automatic door lock/unlock mechanism.

Outcome: Learning actuator control in IoT systems.
